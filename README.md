# Fly to the Limit Website

#Objective
FTTL Needed a website to manage their growing success and increase market awareness of their business.

- Site Map: Home, Tours (Gliding, Helicopter, Cessna, Stunt-Plane), Wanaka/Queenstown Region, About Us/Pilots, Bookings. 5 main navigation items: Home, Tours, Region, About Us, Bookings. Each page to include a general enquiries form and map in the footer.
- Graphic Direction: Large crisp photographs with a few accent colours. A measured scenic palette of navy, white and grey. The overall aesthetic should contain plenty of breathing room to make FTTL look like a company that can provide a safe and scenic outing. Typographic choice: Open Sans 300, 400, 600, 700. Mood: High-end, modern, trustworthy.
- Devices: For the time being, this is a desktop-only website.

#User Testing
- Client: The original design included small graphics next to form field instead of labels. The client preferred having both. 
- Users:
..- All users preferred for the logo in the header to act as a navigation link to the Home page.
..- The tours pages have had a "Book Now" and "Back to Tours" buttons added for convenience.
..- Added graphic divisions to separate galleries from videos.
..- Renamed "Location" nav item to "Region" to avoid confusion between the business address and the surrounding region.
..- Placeholder text in form fields has been differentiated from input text and made to disappear on click.
..- Pilot hovers on the Home page have been changed form crosshairs to radars.

#Features of Interest
- Implimented third-party Javascript libraries and scripts to create galleries, sliders and a date picker.
- Form and placeholder text styled and animated (disappear on click)
- CSS hover effects: background colour and custom graphic for pilots, arrow pointing down when hovering over nav items.
